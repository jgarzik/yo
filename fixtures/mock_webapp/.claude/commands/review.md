# Code Review Command

Review the mock_webapp codebase for common issues.

## Instructions

Please review this codebase and identify:

1. **Security Issues**: Look for hardcoded credentials, API keys, or sensitive data
2. **Deprecated Code**: Find any deprecated functions or patterns
3. **Missing Documentation**: Identify functions without doc comments
4. **Code Smells**: Look for TODO comments, dead code, or poor patterns
5. **Test Coverage Gaps**: Identify untested functionality

Focus on the `src/` directory and provide a summary of findings with file locations.
